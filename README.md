TwistedEquationsTutorial
========================

This package implements several of the TwistedEquations tutorials.
See YouTube TwistedEquations.  Hopefully I'm not stepping on
anyone's toes but have found them to be really useful learning tools.

This implements tutorials 2 through 4.
It implements an app with a single activity.
The activity has a text view and a button.
Clicking the "Press Me" button toggles the 
text view between "Hello Android" and 
"Hello World."

It also has the various 'on...' action
methods and each has a toast item that 
announces when the method is entered.
